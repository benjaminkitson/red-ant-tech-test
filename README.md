# red-ant-tech-test

My submission for Red Ant's developer tech test - a React app that retrieves data about comics from the Marvel API, and presents them to the user as a list.

From there, the user can add a given comic to their favourites list.

Thanks to Red Ant for the opportunity, I had a lot of fun working on this!
